## Achievements
* Delivered a **nationwide network performance dashboard** supporting reliability improvements for **5M+ users**.
* Enabled faster detection and prioritization of network issues across **multiple states**.
* Improved collaboration between operations and engineering teams through shared, data-driven visibility.
* Demonstrated strong product impact by aligning metrics, tooling, and workflows to real operational decisions.

## Product

Large-scale telecom networks generate massive volumes of performance and telemetry data, but operational teams often struggle to convert that data into clear, actionable insights. At Reliance Jio, network teams lacked a unified view to quickly identify bottlenecks, correlate user complaints, and prioritize reliability issues across 4G and 5G infrastructure.

The goal of this product was to build a **network performance intelligence platform** that enabled operations and engineering teams to monitor network health, surface critical issues early, and make data-driven decisions to improve user experience at scale.

The resulting product provided centralized dashboards and analytics that translated complex network data into clear signals for action.

## My Role

* **Problem definition & discovery** — Worked with operations, QA, and engineering stakeholders to understand gaps in visibility, slow incident response, and prioritization challenges.
* **Metric definition** — Identified key reliability and performance indicators tied directly to user experience and network health.
* **Product execution** — Partnered with data engineers and analysts to design dashboards that balanced depth with usability.
* **Iteration & feedback** — Incorporated feedback from on-ground network teams to refine insights and improve decision-making workflows.

## Execution

Execution focused on delivering a product that could scale across regions while remaining simple enough for day-to-day operational use.

The first phase prioritized high-impact views that surfaced congestion patterns, regional outages, and complaint trends. Subsequent iterations improved drill-down capabilities and enabled faster root-cause analysis by correlating network metrics with user-reported issues.

Throughout development, decisions were guided by clarity and actionability—ensuring each metric and visualization directly supported faster response times and better prioritization rather than passive reporting.

## Challenges
* **Data scale and complexity** — Aggregating and normalizing high-volume telemetry data across 4G and 5G networks.
* **Stakeholder alignment** — Balancing the needs of operations, QA, and engineering teams with different success criteria.
* **Signal vs noise** — Ensuring dashboards highlighted actionable insights rather than overwhelming users with raw data.
