## Achievements
* Delivered a **privacy-aware AI framework** demonstrating measurable privacy improvement while maintaining model performance.
* Improved privacy guarantees by **~2%** without compromising scalability or usability.
* Positioned the framework for **potential enterprise adoption**, informed by industry benchmarks and deployment constraints.
* Demonstrated strong PM capability in **bridging research, engineering, and product strategy**.


## Product

As AI systems scale across consumer and enterprise products, organizations face a growing challenge: **how to leverage large-scale data while maintaining strong privacy guarantees**. Many research solutions demonstrate promise in controlled environments but fail to translate into practical, deployable systems.

This product focused on bridging that gap by designing a **privacy-aware AI framework** that could be realistically adopted by enterprise teams without sacrificing performance, scalability, or usability.

The goal was to convert cutting-edge research into a **product-ready AI capability** aligned with real-world constraints and adoption requirements.

## My Role

* **Problem framing & user alignment** — Identified the disconnect between academic privacy research and enterprise deployment needs through collaboration with researchers and industry-aligned stakeholders.
* **Product translation** — Mapped research concepts into concrete product requirements, focusing on performance, reliability, and ease of integration.
* **Metric-driven evaluation** — Defined success metrics that balanced privacy improvement with model accuracy and operational feasibility.
* **Cross-functional collaboration** — Worked closely with researchers and engineers to ensure solutions remained theoretically sound while being practically usable.

## Execution

Execution centered on transforming experimental research into a framework that could survive real-world conditions.

We evaluated multiple architectural and algorithmic approaches, prioritizing those that delivered measurable privacy gains without introducing unacceptable performance degradation. Iterative experimentation focused on validating trade-offs between privacy, accuracy, and scalability, ensuring the solution could fit enterprise data pipelines.

Product decisions were guided by adoption readiness—favoring clarity, configurability, and predictable behavior over purely theoretical improvements.

## Challenges
* **Research-to-product gap** — Translating theoretical privacy improvements into systems that enterprise teams could realistically deploy.
* **Trade-off management** — Balancing privacy guarantees against accuracy, latency, and operational complexity.
* **Stakeholder alignment** — Aligning academic research objectives with industry-driven expectations and constraints.
